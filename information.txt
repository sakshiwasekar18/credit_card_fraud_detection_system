This list (from "Transaction Amount" to "Email Address Domain" and finally "CLASS") represents the ideal feature set for a comprehensive fraud detection system.

The dataset you are working with contains European credit card transactions that occurred over a period of two days in September 2013. The goal of the data is to identify and predict which transactions are fraudulent.
In short, it means:
The Anonymized Features (V1 - V28)
The columns labeled V1, V2, V3, ... up to V28 are the result of applying a data transformation technique called Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

What PCA Does: PCA transforms the original set of features (which would include sensitive details like the cardholder's address, specific time of day, merchant ID, etc.) into a new, smaller set of uncorrelated features.

What V1-V28 Represent: They are the principal components. You cannot know exactly what each one means (e.g., V1 might be a combination of time and location; V2 might relate to the frequency of the card's use).

Why Anonymization is Necessary: To protect the identity of the cardholders and the integrity of the bank's security methods, the raw, personally identifiable features cannot be shared publicly. The V-variables retain the predictive power needed for the machine learning model without revealing the sensitive details.

The Values: Since the data is scaled by PCA, the values are standardized, meaning they are centered around zero and typically range between positive and negative values.
It's the "Before" Picture: This is what the dataset looked like before it was cleaned up and anonymized for public sharing.
It Explains V1-V28: The V1 through V28 variables in your actual project are mathematical transformations of these original 28 features (and others not listed).
